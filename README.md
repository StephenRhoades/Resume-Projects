This is my, Stephen Rhoades,  Highschool senior project in my AP Computer Science class at Battlefield Highschool.
Greenfoot is required to play have this code run properly.
The code has been updated since 2016 to have the gif image animations work properly with the most recent Greenfoot version as of 1/30/2024.
After downloading Greenfoot and this directory, you can run the code by going to the HS_Plant_Vs_Zombies folder and clock on the greenfoot file called project.greenfoot.
Then you simply need to click the run button on the bottom left. Maximizing the window is recommended for best viewing.
